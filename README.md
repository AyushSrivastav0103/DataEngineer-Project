Data Engineering YouTube Analysis Project by Ayush Srivastava

In this project, i have taken Raw Youtube data from Keggle 
and the basic Data engineer job has been done on that Raw data which is mentioned below.

Some cleaning and Data preprocessing was performed on that Raw Data, and hence a Data is fetched 
on which Analysis can be performed by the Data Analysis Person or can be used by the Data scientist 
person for Machine learning.

All this basic work of Data enginner is been performed by using AWS(amazon web services)
The lambda function or the pyspark code(present in the repo) was altered a bit and mostly generated by 
AWS Only.

some commands are also there which has to be given from the command prompt to load the Data from the PC 
to the bucket of AWS.

After successful completion of this project , i have a good idea about AWS services and how to use them
to make the work simpler, I had a good idea about how ETL piplines are made and what exactly is Data 
lake , why it is important to have ETL rather that being dependent on Databases.
